## 🌍 Speaks Your Language

The extension automatically adapts to your VS Code language settings with **linguistically accurate pluralization** following CLDR (Common Locale Data Repository) standards.

**🌎 Americas & Europe:**

- English, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazil & Portugal), French, German, Italian, Dutch

**🌍 Eastern Europe & Middle East:**

- Polish, Czech, Turkish, Russian, Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Greek

### Advanced Pluralization

Unlike simple extensions that only handle singular/plural, we implement proper CLDR plural rules:

- **Slavic Languages** (Russian, Ukrainian, Polish): Use one/few/many forms
  - *Russian*: 1 символ, 2 символа, 5 символов, 21 символ
  - *Polish*: 1 znak, 2 znaki, 5 znaków
  - *Czech*: 1 slovo, 2 slova, 5 slov

- **Portuguese Variants**: Proper "zero" handling
  - *PT-BR*: 0 palavra (singular, normative preference)
  - *PT-PT*: 0 palavras (plural, standard grammar)

- **French**: Zero and one both use singular form
  - *French*: 0 mot, 1 mot, 2 mots

Smart pluralization ensures proper grammar in every language, respecting linguistic nuances and regional preferences.
